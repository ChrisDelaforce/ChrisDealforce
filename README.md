# PROJECT TITLE

## i. Business Case 
<details><summary>show/hide</summary>

Describe the business problem the model would solve, who the audience would be, predicted internal money saved or external revenue.
 Include how this could be achieved by detailling what the y variable would be and the x variables (some examples are enough), where
 this information would be gathered from (comment on its quality), where the labelled data would come from (if applicable).
 Detail the intended timeframe (rough estimates are appropriate) of deadlines for each stage from wrangling to final scripts.
